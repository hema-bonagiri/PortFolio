        <p>
          Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his
          bounty heavily reflecting this fact. He gained his first bounty of
          ¥30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East
          Blue, which then increased to ¥100,000,000 after defeating
          Crocodile in Arabasta. After his crew's invasion into and escape from
          Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to ¥300,000,000. His sizeable
          bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy, along
          with Zoro to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who
          simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over
          ¥100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War.He, the other ten Super
          Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the
          "Worst Generation".
        </p>
        <p>
          Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to ¥400,000,000,
          he entered the New World and began challenging the Emperors and their
          allies directly, with his bounty going up to ¥500,000,000 after
          defeating Donquixote Doflamingo at Dressrosa. Once the world learned
          of Luffy's connection to Sabo, the existence of Straw Hat Grand Fleet,
          and Luffy's infiltration into and escape from Totto Land, his bounty
          shot up all the way to ¥1,500,000,000. After leading the Raid on
          Onigashima and defeating Kaidou, his bounty was increased once more to
          ¥3,000,000,000, placing him as one of the members of the Four
          Emperors.
